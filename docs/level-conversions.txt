Seriously?

(02) ---
Too simple. Also, hard to find a suitable format.

(03) ---
Ditto and ditto.

(04) **
Binary to ASCII could be keep, but a simple look to a table would be too easy
Best way could be a simple riddle (like a binary tree of letters) and giving access to given table only *after* clearing the level proper

(05) *
A magnifying glass to help find small details would be a pretty tool to this level (and to be used further on in the game)

(06) ---
Too simple, maybe not worth reproducing.

(07) ---
Interesting but still too simple. Better save it for the threshold level

(08) *
Slowing down on video player, maybe?
ASCII conversion part could probably be removed, though.

(09) ****
A level with great potential. Better yet if we implement the audio version of it.
Simple piano (not the app) included. Player would need to listen by ear and reproduce the notes by mimicking what is heard. Notes played would appear on a small sheet and with the letters accompanied (for non music people). All is left is for the riddler to find out that the letters form the answer ultimatelly :)

(10) **
Color picker tool needed for it (and a good introduction to another one).
A little work and player would need to find out color hexes form the answer one letter at a time, but that's it.

(11) *
Even though it looks like a Google level, roman numerals should be well known enough for most people
A simple and easy riddle, might be worth a shot

(12) ***
Easy and direct to implement. Keyboards are present on every PC and even smartphones
Just gotta make clear it is a QWERTY one

(13) **
A pickable up all-years calendar would be a must for this one

(14) **
Reversing and speeding up on audio player

(15) ---
Even though a base64 decoder could be interesting, wouldn't it be a giveaway? Too simple yet again

(16) ---
Google level

(17) ***
Another nice one.
Implementation idea: pictures are draggable and movable. Stacking pictures one above the other would add transparency to the stack. The right ones (on any order) would give, as expected, the answer

(18) ***
Could be maybe the first mansion-interactable level?
Player would find himself on some floor panels and would have to walk the right steps on the right order following cardinal directions.
Only problem is that it could be hard work (for me)... Maybe a 2D solution would be a good B plan

(19) **
Hard work to the translators, but might be worth a shot
MS Word reference would need to go away, of course

(20) ---
Google level + HTML thingies, so no
Googol idea is interesting, though...

(21) ???
Yet another Google level. Could it be saved?
Maybe find some correlations between current day continents and Pangea?

(22) **
Finally, the threshold level
Should have more than one needed adjustment, lest it would be not complex enough

(23) ***
With a previously adquired morse translator tool, could be a decent challenge

(24) ???
TODO

(25) ***
Nice idea, IF we could find a way to hide the color map adequately

(26) ---
Yet Another Google Level

(27) ***
Vigenere is recurring, so it might be worth a shot

(28) ***
A calculator is a nice tool to have, nonetheless
Using the right font to simulate calculator digits, we have a good deal

(29) ---
YAGL

(30) ---
Format not applicable.

(31) ???
TODO

(32) ****
Video player + Caesar's Cipher would probably be a great challenge

(33) **
Sort of already implemented.
Easy than it should be since we already start with the tarot cards.

(34) ****
Also already implemented.
Challenging if players have to find letters as an extra step after finding the correct positions

(35) ---
EXIF info? Sadly, too techie

(36) ???
TODO

(37) ***
Reverse pigpen Cipher could be an interesting riddle
This might be the first to need some anagram solver tool, also

(38) ---
Can't say it really fits or is interesting

(39) ****
A nice challenge as it combines greek numerals AND periodic table
Obviously, there should be something about both somewhere...

(40) ???
Hard to circumvent the techie part

(41) ***
Simple concept, but not so direct. Maybe use silence as level's music?
Funny idea: represent hand signals as matchsticks, to further confuse the player

(42) ---
Techie again

(43) **
First part could be adapted as another musical level, who knows?
Second part is kinda funny and could be musically played (together with sheet)

(44) ---
Too much Google and EXIF

(45) ***
First part is out of bounds
Second part could well be conceived as finding the right cards and matching with the figure parts. Fun challenge

(46) ***
Nice idea for another mansion-interactive level
How about finding a button that is found in a real room (and only activated after starting the riddle)?

(47) ***
A fill tool related level. Interesting challenge
Might think having a proper word as the answer, though

(48) ***
Could work by having a phone on the level screen
Keys could flash as the right ones are pressed, revealing the letter(s)

(49) ****
The main idea that could be extracted from this one is terminal interaction. Kinda to feel like a hacker riddle.
However, red herrings are out and I'm not sure about the level index part either...

(50) ??? or *****
Could be a grand multi-part level. Or could be dismembered in several other ones.
There are some individual ideas in each sub-level, so it might be worth remembering them

(51) ---
Hard to convey

(52) ???
English specific. Probably would go out

(53) ***
Nice challenge, letter parts could be show continuously even
Reminds me of some old Flash game I played a long time ago...

(54) ***
A similar idea could be implemented, albeit with just one screen instead of two

(55) ---
Too. Much. Google.

(56) **
Could be a nice (and easy) challenge with a previous gathered Pi chart

(57) ---
Would need some previous googling and the answer is kinda... dumb?

(58) ---
Good level, but sadly too techie

(59) ---
Too photoshop-heavy to be implemented

(60) ---
The last one is too internet inclined to be of use also, sadly
